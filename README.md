- Finally, click 'Add SSH Key'

### Configure Default Branch for Git Init

- Verify your version of Git by running `git --version`
If your version number is below 2.28, then proceed with the steps below. Otherwise, skip to the steps under Version 2.28.

#### Below Version 2.28
- Open the Terminal
- Download the configure script by running: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackcodherbootcamp/setup-guide/main/script.sh`
- Then run `./script.sh`
